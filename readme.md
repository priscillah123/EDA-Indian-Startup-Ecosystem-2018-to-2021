# Data Analysis Project -- Indian Start-up Funding Analysis

This project involved using the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework to analyze data on startup growth, funding patterns, success rates, regional concentration, and market penetration of the Indian Startup Ecosystem between **2018 and 2021**.

The objective, as a data analyst, was to draw insights on the available data from 4 tables and give actionable insights and recommendations to our team that, hypothetically speaking, wants to venture into the Indian startup market. The project utilized advanced statistical techniques and visualization tools to draw meaningful conclusions and present our findings effectively.

## Process

-   Pull data from remote database with pyodbc; save as csv files

-   Develop questions and a hypothesis to base analysis of the project on

-   Understand the data and make decisions on how to process the data

-   Data preprocessing, cleaning and merging- The data was very messy and 90% of the project involved cleaning and making the data ready for analysis and visualizations

-   Visualise the data with seaborn and pyplot

-   Created a PowerBI dashboard with the visualizations

-   Wrote a medium article and briefly described the process, findings and recommendations
